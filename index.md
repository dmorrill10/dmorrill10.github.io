I'm a PhD student at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) working under the supervision of [Professor Michael Bowling](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling/). I was part of the [DeepStack](https://www.deepstack.ai) project and the [Cepheus](http://poker.srv.ualberta.ca/) project, the latter only in the capacity of creating and managing the [public match interface](http://poker-play.srv.ualberta.ca/). I'm now working on broadening the applicability of game theoretic algorithms, particularly by making connections to safe artificial intelligence and incorporating function approximation. I also manage the [University of Alberta poker research group's website](http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/).

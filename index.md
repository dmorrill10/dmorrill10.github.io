I'm a PhD student at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) working under the supervision of [Professor Michael Bowling](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling/). I was part of the [DeepStack](https://www.deepstack.ai) project and the [Cepheus](http://poker.srv.ualberta.ca/) project, the latter only in the capacity of creating and managing the [public match interface](http://poker-play.srv.ualberta.ca/). I'm now working on broadening the applicability of game theoretic algorithms, particularly by making connections to safe reinforcement learning and incorporating function approximation. I also manage the [Computer Poker Research Group website](http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/).

I completed a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in computing science also at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/). My M.Sc was also supervised by [Michael Bowling](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling/). As an undergraduate, I worked with the [Computer Poker Research Group website](http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/), most significantly to develop a [generic poker playing interface](https://github.com/dmorrill10/acpc_poker_gui_client) for the [Annual Computer Poker Competition (ACPC)](http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/) and for creating the 1st-place 3-player Kuhn poker entry in the 2014 (ACPC).

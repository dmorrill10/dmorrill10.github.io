## About

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) and the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/), co-supervised by [Professor Michael Bowling](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling/) and [Professor Amy Greenwald](http://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/amy/).
I work on multi-agent learning and scaleable, dependable learning algorithms.
I'm a coauthor of [DeepStack](https://www.deepstack.ai) and I created [Cepheus](http://poker.srv.ualberta.ca/)'s [public match interface](http://poker-play.srv.ualberta.ca/).
I also manage the [Computer Poker Research Group (CPRG) website](http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/).
I completed a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in computing science at the University of Alberta where my M.Sc was supervised by Michael Bowling.
As an undergraduate, I worked with the CPRG to create an [open-source web interface to play against poker bots](https://github.com/dmorrill10/acpc_poker_gui_client) and to develop the 1st-place 3-player Kuhn poker entry in the 2014 [Annual Computer Poker Competition (ACPC)](http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/).

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) working with [Professor Michael Bowling](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling/). I was part of the [DeepStack](https://www.deepstack.ai) and [Cepheus](http://poker.srv.ualberta.ca/) poker projects, as a coauthor on the former and as a software engineer on the latter. Specifically, I manage [Cepheus's public match interface](http://poker-play.srv.ualberta.ca/) that I also wrote. I'm now working on broadening the applicability of game theoretic algorithms, particularly by making connections to safe reinforcement learning and incorporating function approximation. I also manage the [Computer Poker Research Group (CPRG) website](http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/).

I completed a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in computing science also at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/). My M.Sc was also supervised by [Michael Bowling](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling/). As an undergraduate, I worked with the [CPRG](http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/) to create an [open-source web interface to play against poker bots](https://github.com/dmorrill10/acpc_poker_gui_client) and to develop the 1st-place 3-player Kuhn poker entry in the 2014 [Annual Computer Poker Competition (ACPC)](http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/).

## Projects

`2017`
**Play DeepStack Web Application**

- Web application that allows people to play [DeepStack](https://deepstack.ai/), the first program to defeat professional poker players at no-limit Texas hold'em, as shown in [Twitch streams](https://www.twitch.tv/deepstackai). See the March 2017 [*Science* article](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/poker/17science.html) for more details on DeepStack and DeepStack's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4vSx3bbs8dbaHl2tkzU8Nw) for match videos.
- 
- I both developed this application and maintained DeepStack's private server during the first season of DeepStack's Twitch matches.

`2015`
**Play Cepheus Web Application**

- Web application that allows people to play [Cepheus](http://poker.srv.ualberta.ca/), the solution to heads-up limit Texas hold'em computed by the [Computer Poker Research Group](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/poker/) at [The University of Alberta](http://ualberta.ca/). See the January 2015 [*Science* article](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/poker/15science.html) for more details. It is a modification of the [ACPC Poker GUI Client](https://github.com/dmorrill10/acpc_poker_gui_client).
- 
- I both developed this application and maintain Cepheus's [public server](http://poker-play.srv.ualberta.ca/).

`2011`
**ACPC Poker GUI Client**

- The Annual Computer Poker Competition Poker Gui Client provides a graphical user interface with which people may play poker games against automated agents. It supports two-player and three-player limit and no-limit Texas Hold'em, as well as three-player Kuhn. It can support any game supported by the ACPC Dealer as well.
- 
- This application is built with Ruby and Rails and began as an independent study project supervised by [Dr. Duane Szafron](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~duane/) at [The University of Alberta](http://ualberta.ca/).
- 
- A modified version of this application is used in the [*Play Cepheus* application](http://poker-play.srv.ualberta.ca/).

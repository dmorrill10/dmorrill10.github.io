Yesterday I was learning about how to work with a new cluster and one of the grad students emailed some scripts to me, and I couldn't help but think, "why aren't these in a version control repository that I can just grab?". I'm so used to using [GitHub](github.com/) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) (free private repos are very handy) for everything, that moving files by email seems so archaic. To top it off, while looking through the emailed scripts, we found that they were not the most up to date versions and a couple lines had to be changed.

With these scripts, it's probably not an excuse, but in general, there might be some security issues.
